# Health Disease Predictor ❤️

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes.

---
## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict heart disease.  
The model is trained on a medical dataset containing patient health parameters.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Libraries Used:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following features:

- age  
- sex  
- chest pain type  
- resting blood pressure  
- cholesterol  
- fasting blood sugar  
- resting ECG  
- maximum heart rate  
- exercise induced angina  
- ST depression  
- slope  
- number of vessels  
- thalassemia  

Target variable:
- `0` → No Heart Disease  
- `1` → Heart Disease

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Train-Test Split
4. Feature Scaling
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Prediction on New Data

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook `Health_Disease_Predictor.ipynb`
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Enter patient data to get prediction
